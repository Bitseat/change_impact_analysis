      <p><u>Check Similarity</u><br>
        The” view CIA result” window holds a table containing issue id , similarity value and the
        description of the top 5 most related or most highly impacted requirements by the
        addition of the new requirement into the project.<br><br>
        <u>Verify validity of link between requirement and test case</u><br><br>
        The requirement traceability sidebar menu on the left opens a page where the user enters the
        description of a requirement and the corresponding test case she/he wants to validate with.
        Then the model will give as an output whether the links between the two are valid or not
        meaning, whether they have strong link or weak link respectively.</p>
